### Integrations

#### Integration
- **Description:** Application routing composes blank layout for auth feature, admin layout guarded by authGuard for home, and lazy-loads NotFoundComponent for wildcard fallback.
- **Frontend Component:** Angular router config
- **Backend Endpoint:** N/A
- **Data Flow:** App bootstrap -> router redirects '' to /home -> auth path uses BlankLayout and lazy loads AUTH_ROUTES -> default path uses AdminLayout with authGuard and lazy loads HOME_ROUTES -> unknown paths lazy-load NotFoundComponent
